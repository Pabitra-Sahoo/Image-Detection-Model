## Image Prediction using MobileNetV2 Model 
# Introduction :
In this code snippet, I am utilizing the MobileNetV2 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, to 
predict the contents of various images. The MobileNetV2 model is a convolutional neural network 
that is efficient and well-suited for mobile and embedded vision applications. 
# Key Concepts: 
MobileNetV2 Model: A lightweight deep learning model designed for mobile and edge devices. 

Image Prediction: Using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to predict the contents of images. 

Preprocessing: Loading, resizing, and preprocessing images before feeding them into the model for 
# Detection:
Visualization: Displaying the images along with their predicted classes and confidence scores. 
Code Structure: 
Loading the Model: The code loads the MobileNetV2 model with pre-trained weights from 
TensorFlow's model zoo. 

Defining Image Paths: An array of image paths is defined for the images we want to predict.

Predict and Display Function: A function predict_and_display is defined to preprocess the image, 
make predictions using the model, display the image, and print the predicted classes with confidence 
scores. 

Function Invocation: The function is called for each image path in the array to predict and display the 
images. 
# Conclusion:
This code demonstrates how to use the MobileNetV2 model to predict the contents of images. By leveraging a pre-trained model like MobileNetV2, we can quickly and efficiently classify images with high accuracy. The code showcases image preprocessing, prediction, and visualization, making it a valuable resource for image recognition tasks.


I have given the sample images to test my code and my image prediction 
model will successfully predict them.
